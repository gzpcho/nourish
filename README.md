Baby Monitors? Dog Cams? These tools are impractical to us plant parents. Between the chaotic disarray of weekdays, the health and well-being of plants can easily be neglected. Google Calendar and memo apps are temporary solutions which easily clutter as your botanical family expands.

Nourish is a React Native app built with the Expo framework that synthesizes an organic UI which streamlines the plant parenting process.
